### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm Viktoria, a Computer Science student passionate about **design, and learning new stuff about programming!**.

I have always been creative all my life and I love making stuff, whether it's sewing, painting, building stuff.
That's what made me interested in computer science, I get to be creative and make things where imagination is the only limit!
